              My concept for this project was under the umbrella of Simulacra as described by Jean Baudrillard.
              This project explores the relationship between the human body and computerised technologies.
              In a technologically attuned civilisation we are surrounded by computer technology which
              augments the human body.
            </p>

            <p>
              A human body with powers beyond its natural form serves as a prosthetic enhancement of its faculties.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project explores concepts of “The Cyborg” as theorised by Donna Haraway and the implications
              of computerised technology on human embodiment and subjectivity, and also seeks to understand
              notions of human experience as mediated through technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              I approached this project with the idea of attempting to depict the symbiotic relationship
              between humans and technology, in particular “Cyborg Intentionality” as described by Don Ihde.

              As our realities become ever more digital, and our experiences become simulated, what does
              “real” even mean anymore and how does that affect our relationship with ourselves and each other?
            </p>

            <p>
              Will we succumb to virtual reality as post-humans similar to the figures in the Wachowskis’
              Matrix saga, or eschew the human body in favour of cybernetic super-enhancement as seen in
              Ghost in the Shell and Deus Ex?
            </p>
